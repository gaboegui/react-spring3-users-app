# Users Application

This project is a full-stack user management application, consisting of a React-based frontend and a Spring Boot 3 backend.

## Overview

The application provides a complete solution for managing users, including features like user authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for user data.

### Frontend (`front-users-app`)

The frontend is a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) built with React. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators and users to manage user accounts.

For more detailed information about the frontend, including setup and development instructions, please refer to the [frontend README](./front-users-app/README.md).

### Backend (`backend-users-app`)

The backend is a robust and secure RESTful API built with Spring Boot. It handles all business logic, data persistence, and security for the application.

For more detailed information about the backend, including API documentation and setup instructions, please refer to the [backend README](./backend-users-app/README.md).
